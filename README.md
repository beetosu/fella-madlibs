# Cool Fellas!

In this project we kinda do two distinct operations, that kind of overlap:

## Randomly Generate Names (Python)

First, as kind of a drawing prompt, I have created a way to randomly geenerate some names for the various people I draw here! I just combine a bunch of real names with a variety of nouns/adjectives/adverbs to get a unique combination! I give myself final say and the opportunity to reroll entirely, but regardless the new name is saved into the fellas.json!

## Showcase the Fellas (JS/HTML)

Once we have the fellas listed in JSON (and by this point have actually drawn the fella prompted), we can now showcase the new fella on the site! That just grabs the JSON, and randomly selects a name/image to showcase.
